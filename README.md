## Graphical Neural Network

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning methods that work in the graph domain. 
These networks have recently been applied in multiple areas including; combinatorial optimization, recommender systems, and computer vision â€“ just to mention a few.
These networks can also be used to model large systems such as social networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and knowledge graphs among other research areas. 
Unlike other data such as images, graph data works in the non-Euclidean space. Graph analysis is therefore aimed at node classification, link prediction, and clustering.

## Why Use Graphs?
Graphs provide a better way of dealing with abstract concepts like relationships and interactions. 
They also offer an intuitively visual way of thinking about these concepts. 
Graphs also form a natural basis for analyzing relationships in a social context.
Graphs can solve more complex problems by simplifying the problems into simpler representations or transforming the problems into representations from different perspectives.

## Traditional Graph Analysis Methods:
The limitation of such algorithms is that we need to gain prior knowledge of the graph at certain confidence before we can apply the algorithm. 
In other words, it provides no means for us to study the graph itself. And most importantly, there is no way to perform graph level 
classification.
Hence, we use Graph Neural Network.
Graph Neural Network, as how it is called, is a neural network that can directly be applied to graphs. 
It provides a convenient way for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks.
