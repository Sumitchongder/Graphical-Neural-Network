## Graphical Neural Network

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a set of deep learning methods that work in the graph domain. 
These networks have recently been applied in multiple areas including; combinatorial optimization, recommender systems, computer vision â€“ just to mention a few.
These networks can also be used to model large systems such as social networks, proteinprotein interaction networks, knowledge graphs among other research areas. 
Unlike other data such as images, graph data works in the non-Euclidean space. Graph analysis is therefore aimed at node classification, link prediction, and clustering.
