## Graphical Neural Network

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning methods that work in the graph domain. 
These networks have recently been applied in multiple areas including; combinatorial optimization, recommender systems, and computer vision â€“ just to mention a few.
These networks can also be used to model large systems such as social networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and knowledge graphs among other research areas. 
Unlike other data such as images, graph data works in the non-Euclidean space. Graph analysis is therefore aimed at node classification, link prediction, and clustering.

## Why Use Graphs?
Graphs provide a better way of dealing with abstract concepts like relationships and interactions. 
They also offer an intuitively visual way of thinking about these concepts. 
Graphs also form a natural basis for analyzing relationships in a social context.
Graphs can solve more complex problems by simplifying the problems into simpler representations or transforming the problems into representations from different perspectives.

## Traditional Graph Analysis Methods:
The limitation of such algorithms is that we need to gain prior knowledge of the graph at certain confidence before we can apply the algorithm. 
In other words, it provides no means for us to study the graph itself. And most importantly, there is no way to perform graph level 
classification.
Hence, we use Graph Neural Network.
Graph Neural Network, as how it is called, is a neural network that can directly be applied to graphs. 
It provides a convenient way for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks.

## MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT
GNN is still a relatively new area and is worthy of more research attention. 
It is a powerful tool to analyze graph data. Yet it is not limited to only problems in graphs. 
It can be easily generalized to any studies that can be modeled by graphs. And graph modeling is a natural way to analyze a problem.

### GNN in Natural Language Processing
GNN is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Actually, this is also where GNN initially gets started. 
If some of you have experience in NLP, you must be thinking that text should be a type of sequential or temporal data that can be best described by an RNN or an LTSM. 
Well, GNN approaches the problem from a completely different angle. 
GNN utilized the inner relations of words or documents to predict the categories.

### GNN in Computer Vision
Many CNN-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in object detection in images, but yet we do not know the relationships between the objects. 
One successful employment of GNN in CV is using graphs to model the relationships between objects detected by a CNN-based detector.
